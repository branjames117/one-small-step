# One Small Step

## Description

One Small Step (stylized as 1SS) is meant to be a one-stop shop or resource hub for all lovers of astronomy, utilizing the significant public investment in NASA. Our first group project in the Vanderbilt Full-stack Coding Bootcamp taught us how to overcome challenges involving collaborating with Git as well as project management skills such as role delegation, Scrum meetings, and Kanban boards.
